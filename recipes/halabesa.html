        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Halabesa aka Humos Alsham,
            a vegan traditional Egyptian soup of chickpeas to break our fast with. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This same cumin-spiked chickpeas broth is considered a typical Egyptian winter street food.<br>
            The boiling hot broth along with the toasted dry pepper flakes are enough to warm up a weary soul on a bleak winter night.
        </p>
        <p>
            This soup is best made from scratch with dry chickpeas and NOT the canned ones.
